// Refuse to ship a bundle that a stale JavaScript engine cannot even parse.
//
// Lookbehind is a *parse*-time syntax error on Safari below 16.4, which means
// one regex literal anywhere in main.js stops the whole plugin from loading on
// older iOS. Not the feature that uses it: all of it.
//
// This exists because that shipped, in a sibling plugin. The source was clean
// and the directory linter was happy, but the linter only reads src/, and
// Obsidian loads the bundle: a dependency had contributed a lookbehind literal
// of its own, so a plugin whose own code had none still could not start. This
// plugin has no runtime dependencies today, which makes the check cheap
// insurance rather than a live concern, and exactly the kind of guard that is
// worth having in place before the first one arrives.
//
// esbuild.config.mjs now declares the feature unavailable, which makes esbuild
// emit new RegExp("...") instead. A string is parsed lazily, so an old engine
// only trips if that code path actually runs. This check proves the setting is
// still doing its job: re-transforming the finished bundle with the same
// setting must find nothing left to convert. If someone drops the setting, or
// a future dependency slips a literal through some path esbuild does not
// cover, the delta goes positive and the build stops here.
//
// Run by esbuild.config.mjs after a production build; also fine on its own.
